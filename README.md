Fibonacci is a tool for calculating
[Fibonacci Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
I created it so that I could take part in the fun going on at

## Ant Targets
* `main` : Executes `compile` and `jar`.
* `compile` : Compiles the source.
* `jar` : Builds the executable .jar file from the compiled source.
* `run` : attempts to execute the .jar file.
* `clean` : Removes the build directory.
